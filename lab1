1.To check virtualization support, enter BIOS/UEFI during boot (F2, F10, or DEL). Look for Intel VT-x or AMD-V, and enable it if available.

2.Cloud success is based on scalability, cost efficiency, and accessibility.
  Pros: Lower cost, elastic scalability, anywhere access.
  Cons: Security/privacy risks, strong internet dependency, vendor lock-

3.A hypervisor manages and allocates physical hardware resources to virtual machines, enabling multiple VMs to run on one host.

4.A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, with its own operating system and applications.

5.Benefits of virtual machines include cost savings, higher resource utilization, improved security through isolation, flexibility/portability, and support for testing and development.

6.Common use cases: software development/testing, running multiple operating systems, server consolidation, disaster recovery, and malware analysis or sandboxing.
